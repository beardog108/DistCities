## About
DistCities is a spiritual successor of GeoCities, but using torrent technology with [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io) to make it more resilient and distributed.

DistCities does not rely on any central server. Pages hosted on one domain (or a local disk) are available elsewhere too.

The caveat is that at least 1 person must keep a page open (or seeding in another WebTorrent client) for it to be available.
